# Choosing Names

It is easier to understand the purpose of the function `facial_recognition` than one called `facer`.   
Using good naming practices and choosing names that clarify your intent makes your software better:  
easier to maintain, nicer for others to use and peruse, and it smooths later collaborative work.   
These brief guides and their examples collect information on best practices and sound approaches.
